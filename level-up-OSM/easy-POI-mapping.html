              <p>New editor for users that want to add their shop/restaurant/office. And update info such as opening hours.</p>
              <p>Assumes no knowledge about OpenStreetMap, plenty of hand holding, guides user.</p>
              <p>Doing this should be easier than editing such data in Google Maps.</p>
              <p>There is this generator of dead notes, this would edit directly</p>
              <p>Danger: maps.me quality edits, people misusing it to own object, putting ad text in name of object...</p>
              <p>TODO: find name not implying ownership of OSM object</p>
              <p>Investigate existing projects - maybe <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSMyBiz">OSMyBiz</a> should be expanded/popularized instead?</p>
              <p><a href="https://www.onosm.org/">onosm</a> exists but is quite misleading - it generates notes that with rare exception sit ignored for years. And in effect is not helpful to either mappers nor people trying to add their business.</p> 
              <h3>Produced work</h3>
              <p>For start, survey existing tools. Maybe new project is not needed here?</p>
              <p>App/Webapp/Website allowing to add shop/amenity/POI in general, guiding user to avoid problem of MAPS.ME like placing shop in the middle of street</p>
              <p>The first big expansion: ability to add and edit opening hours</p>
