              <h1>Fix registration form</h1>
              <!-- synchronize beginning with main level-up-OSM page -->
              <p>Current one is a real barrier (revealed by my <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1470">UX testing of StreetComplete</a>)<p>
              
              <p>Registering with another account is resulting in unexpected and cumbersome flow. There are unneded elements. Overall experience is atrocious on mobile devices and subotimal on fully-sized monitors. Poor design here is one of pointless and primarily technical barriers for potential mappers.</p>

              <p>Public domain checkbox. Is it really needed? ("In addition to the above, I consider my contributions to be in the Public Domain (<a href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Licence_and_Legal_FAQ/Why_would_I_want_my_contributions_to_be_public_domain">what's this?</a>)")</p>

              <p>See <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/2287">#2287</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/2288">#2288</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/894">#894</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/3259">#3259</a></p>

              <h2>Produced work</h2>
              <p>Run basic testing on mobile and desktop and look for obvious breakage like <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/3259">#3259</a>. Is content still overlapping forms? Is there an open issue for that? This would take about 4h.</p>
              <p>Fix obvious layout issues - again, cases like <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website/issues/3259">#3259</a>. Time estimate unknown, especially as number of such problems is unknown.</p>
              <p>Documentation why each element of registration form is needed - to find is there any part that can be dropped (is public domain checkbox worth confusion caused by it?).</p>
              <p>A working propotype of a simplied form. Time estimate - I am really unsure here how much time I would need.</p>
