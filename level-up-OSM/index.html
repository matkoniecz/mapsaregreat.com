        <h1>Listing project ideas for improving OpenStreetMap</h1>
        <p>Mapping projects are excluded from this list, only less direct projects are listed here.</p>
        <p>Projects below are NOT reserved, feel free to work of them!</p>
        <p>In general ideas are not worth much, 99.9% of input is actual work, not idea stuff.</p>
        <p>Though pointless well done work is quite sad, so selecting a good target is worth spending some time on.</p>
        <p>I created this list primarily for my own use, as I wanted to organise my chaotic TODO lists. Also, it will be useful when applying for grant supporting OpenStreetMap-related development. But it may be useful as inspiration for your own work, maybe GSoC proposal or something similar.</p>
        <p>If you see mistakes, something unclear or it is unclear why working on a given project makes sense - <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@gmail.com">let me know</a>. It is intended to be human-readable in general.</p>
        <p>In case that someone would be interested in sponsoring work on projects below - feel free to <a href="mailto:matkoniecz@gmail.com">contact me</a>. Note that in some cases I would first need to ask other involved people. For example in case of JOSM I am unsure what is the position of JOSM maintainers. It would be definitely fine for independent projects, where I am the main author and for StreetComplete. (TODO: note status for each project to make it more clear)</p>
        <p>If you are aware about existing work on a given proposal - also let me know! With rare exceptions it is better to join existing project over starting a new one.</p>

              <p>Work toward iOS app would be a good target, see <a href="https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/issues/1892">analysis estimating total work for about 7 months</a>. Note that it is an optimistic estimate and assume experienced iOS developer. I am not one, but there are big parts that are also an independent improvements and doing them will reduce total workload and make iOS port closer.</p>

              <p>Next danger is risk that goverments are not actually interested at all in real analysis and currently done simulations are purely smokescreens. And any actual simulation would be ignored.</p>

Is there any easy to use maker of osm based maps?

Is there any tool where I can easily do something like that
- show trees in this specific shade of green (selected in color picker)
- water in that shade of blue (selected in a color picker)
- mark marinas with sailboat icon (selected in the drop-down or uploaded)

And specify area for rendering and export
- the generated map (SVG vector)
- rendered data (as geojson)
- map style (in human-readable format like JSON)
- link to the current work (so it can be shared/saved)

Maposmatic allows to generate map in one of existing map styles, not to define new map style.
 
I also know about uMap - but this is for putting some stuff on map that is
modified

I know about Kosmstik and MapCSS in Overpass Turbo, but it is programming

https://discord.com/channels/413070382636072960/413070502580453387/865113704244183052
https://www.maptiler.com/cloud/customize/ - it exists!
Mapbox studio
Is there lock in in either of them?

Is there any OpenStreetMap based search that gives decent and quick answers for
queries like "restaurant", "kebab", "buy fridge", "tourism attraction"?

Osmand, mapy.cz, Organic Maps sort of implement this but you need to wait forever for answer (3s for Osmand search for "Decathlon" in Kraków - returns also results 700km away).

Google right now is stomping over OSM here, even where OSM data is as good as Google what is quite sad.

Not entirely sure why it is so tragically slow, but I suspect that apps are searching not just in the nearby area but across all downloaded maps and then discard 99.99% of found results.

Nominatim is not trying hard to do this, and judging by project name it may be even out of scope there.
https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/ui/search.html?q=bars+in+london

Done in: https://www.qwant.com/maps Overpass Wizard

Alternatives: open issue in Osmand (done https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd/issues/12126 )/ Organic Maps ( https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/issues/867 )
Profile organic maps and osmand

output: prototype - not available to general public as hosting maps is not trivial. Maybe self-feeding with Overpass? But note limits.
