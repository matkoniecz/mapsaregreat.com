          <h1>Why OpenStreetMap is not known more widely?</h1>
          <p>People are often using and appreciating OpenStreetMap data without being aware at all about its source.</p>
          <p>OpenStreetMap license requires giving a clearly visibly credit.</p>
          <p>We should start treating this requirement seriously, as ongoing plagiarism is harmful to OpenStreetMap project.</p>
          <p>Slides about this topic, for State of the Map 2021 presentation <a href="Matusz Konieczny - Why OpenStreetMap is not known more widely - SOTM 2021 - slides.odp">are available</a>.</p>


          Presentation text is below. Note that exact recording on SotM 2021 may have some extra mistakes or present things in a different order. As usual, feedback about what can be improved in my English is welcomed. Also, please report if there are some factual inaccuracies here.

        <h1>Presentation text</h1>
        
        
        <p>Hello! I want to describe one of our problems. Solving it will make OpenStreetMap known more<!-- /łajdli/--> widely.</p>       
        
        <p>I want to start by saying a bit about myself.</p>
        <p>I am a quite active mapper, mostly mapping what I encounter while cycling, hiking and walking.</p>
         
        
        <p>As a programmer I helped to improve several OpenStreetMap related programs. It is likely that you used some of the features that I implemented. Especially if you map with StreetComplete, the Android application where mapping can be done by answering simple questions. I made significant contributions there, I also<!--/olsął/--> improved other software.</p>
        
        <p>My latest project is a 3D<!--/taktyl/--> tactile map for<!-- /blajnd/--> children and ones with a poor <!--/ajsajt/--> eyesight.</p>
        
        </br>
        
        <h2>Thanks to</h2>
        
        <p>I want to start from a big “thank you” to everyone who is using OpenStreetMap data and has honestly tried to credit authors.</p>
        
        <p></p>Wikimedia Commons app, making it easy to contribute photos on open license to, well, Wikimedia Commons project. It used to have no real attribution but it is now<!-- /nał/ -->fixed.</p>
        
        <p>OpenStreetMap maps are appearing<!-- /epirin/apirin/--> not only on screens, but also<!-- /olsął/--> on information boards.</p>
        
        <p>I really was pleasantly surprised by this one, I had an opportunity to map an OpenStreetMap. Yet, it is not 100% ideal as license is not mentioned - despite that it should be - but far above average</p>
        
        <p>OsmAnd - here I primarily like a quick reaction. After pointing out that they should attribute OpenStreetMap more prominently and giving a clear idea how to improve the situation it was fixed almost immediately.</p>
        
        <p>To be clear that is not a full list, there is not enough space to list all. And there are many other examples!</p>
        
        <p>Thanks to everyone who placed a clearly visible attribution. Also<!-- /olsął/--> on mobile devices.</p>
        
        </br>
        
        <h2>But sadly it is not always happening</h2>
        
        <p>Two years ago I helped a pair of tourists. They had some trouble figuring out the bus route. While we were at the bus stop waiting for their bus we talked a bit.</p>

        <p>Somehow the discussion ended on the topic of maps. I mentioned and described OpenStreetMap. They commented that it sounds like an interesting project. But it seemed to them to be an unnecessary duplicate of maps.me with its great maps that they were using to navigate.</p>
        
        <p>They were completely unaware that all useful data displayed by maps.me is from the OpenStreetMap.</p>
        
        <p>An important part is that the duty of people who made MAPS.ME was to ensure that people will be aware of it. It is one of few conditions required to be able to use the amazing resource of OpenStreetMap data.</p>
        
        <p>To be more specific, it is mandated by ODbL, the OpenStreetMap license.</p>
        <h2>What is the point of OpenStreetMap?
            <br>
          MAPS.ME has great maps already
        </h2>
        <p>And while OpenStreetMap is mentioned by Maps.me the "OpenStreetMap" label is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>blocked by an internal ad</li>
            <li>shown for two seconds</li>
            <li>maps.me text is shown forever</li>
            <li>maps.me is ignoring report about problem for two years, in meantime the company was sold and its app stopped being open source</li>
        </ul>
        

       </br>
        <h2>From ODbL, license of OpenStreetMap data</h2>
          <p>You must include a notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the Produced Work aware that Content was obtained from the Database, Derivative Database, or the Database as part of a Collective Database, and that it is available under this License.

        <h2>we need more mappers and one of barriers is that people are simply unaware about OSM</h2>
        
        I am pretty sure that OpenStreetMap would benefit from more mappers.
        Especially hobby mappers mapping their area.
        
        </br>
        
        <p>Plenty of things can be said about what may discourage people - starting from general society issues.</p>
        
        <p>After all, someone unable to pay for food, shelter and basic necessities is quite unlikely<!-- /anlajkli/--> to become involved in a time-consuming hobby.</p>
        
        <p>Being told your whole life that maps are not for women is going to have some effects. And it is not going to have a positive effect on how many women are going to join a map-centric project.</p>
        
        <p>And many things can be improved in OpenStreetMap itself. Improving community so more people will want to join and stay. And there are also<!-- /olsął/--> many things that are caused by lacking or poor tools.</p>

        <p></p>For example, try to register for an OpenStreetMap account on a smartphone. The registration form is basically<!-- /bejzikli/--> self-parody.</p>
        
        <p>On mobile devices the edit button does not mention existing apps and directs to desktop software, unusable on mobile.</p>
        
        <p>Editing software can be much, much more user friendly and effective - that is why I am involved in making StreetComplete.</p>
        
        <p>About how the community can be improved and how to achieve that and how it may go wrong plenty of things can be said so I will not go into detail here.</p>
        
        </br>
        
        <p>But all those barriers matter only if someone is aware that OpenStreetMap exists.</p>
        
        <h2>people unaware that OSM exists will not join to map the world</h2>

        <p>OpenStreetMap community has a legal and ethical right to demand a clear attribution.</p>
       
        <p>Luckily anyone using OpenStreetMap is obligated to ensure that users will be aware of the source of data.</p>

<p>In reality it is a bit more tricky, in some cases attribution is not required. This includes for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>tiny extracts - in extreme case if I use a single point then I am not obligated to attribute </li>
<li>private use of OpenStreetMap data, for example, if I make an illustrated private diary then illustration</li>
<li>de minimis - if I take a photo of group of OpenStreetMap mappers and in photo there is also /olsął/ - as a detail - tiny screen with opened editor showing OpenStreetMap data then license is not triggered</li>
</ul>

<p>But in a typical case, for what would be described as "using OpenStreetMap data" the attribution requirement from the OpenStreetMap license applies.</p>

  <p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Map in app available to public</li>
<li>Map given as a gift to a friend</li>
<li>Map in a public place</li>
</ul>

<h2>warning: I am not a lawyer</h2>
<p>This is a good moment to mention that I am not a lawyer.</p>

<p>Consult a lawyer if you need a lawyer. But it is clear, no lawyer required, that:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>ODbL license of OpenStreetMap requires a clearly visible attribution</li>
  <li>Many uses of OpenStreetMap data have no clearly visible attribution</li>
  </ol>


<h2>Why OpenStreetMap benefits from being known more widely</h2>

<h3>More mappers</h3>
<p>More people would be aware about OSM. Some of them would become involved. Yes, it also /olsął/ will have negative effects like more vandalism and spam - but I am sure that positives would be much greater.</p>

<p>But overall it would reduce maybe the greater barrier to contributing as a mapper - by people becoming aware that the project still exists.</p>

<p>It still would be necessary to make clear that anyone can contribute and is welcomed, to avoid scaring them away, make it more likely that they will have a good time contributing and so on.</p>

<p>But only a small part of the world is aware that OSM exists and working on changing this would be a good idea.</p>

<h3>Greater diversity<!--/dajw!ersiti/--></h3>
<p>Currently to be aware about OSM you need to be quite unusual. What contributes to the OSM community not matching at all global or even local communities. There are many reasons for that, but it is one of them.</p>

<h3>Treated more seriously</h3>
<p>With greater awareness how widely OSM data is used it would be easier to get permission to access various data, more people would be aware that this data can be used and would build something amazing with it, easier access to funding for OpenStreetMap related projects.</p>

<p>People are more likely to contribute if they see OpenStreetMap data used over and over again</p>

<h2>More entities using OpenStreetMap data without attribution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution">“Lacking proper attribution” on the OSM Wiki</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/matkoniecz/illegal-use-of-OpenStreetMap">My listing of eggregious cases</a></li>
  </ul>
<h3>Snapchat</h3>
<p>Email in 2019 (ignored). Report via Mapbox as they use Mapbox hosting - send in 2019. Assigned 77032 id. Mapbox replied on 2020-01-13 that they gave Snapchat some unspecific deadline.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, reminders in 2020 and 2021 were also ignored.</p>

<h3>Mapbox</h3>
<p>Reported in 2019 via their form (report was assigned id 77176).</p>
  
<p>Mapbox claims that showing OpenStreetMap attribution after the interaction while clearly attributing itself is fulfilling OdbL (“notice associated with the Produced Work reasonably calculated to make any Person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with”).</p>

<h3>What can be done?</h3>

<p>Often a simple email works. All examples here are from June 2021.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.lpr.com.pl/pl/ladowiska/mapa-miejsc-gminnych-oraz-ladowisk-przyszpitalnych/">LPR landing map</a> - at least they really tried, but Google logo is now shown only on the full screen :)</li>
  <li>European Data Portal operated by European Union, now mention OpenStreetMap <a href="https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets">both in overview</a> and <a href="https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/ead36f39-da76-4369-b35a-252e400b206a?locale=en">on pages of specific datasets</a>. Also not ideal and a bit misleading, but now OpenStreetMap is at least mentioned</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.krakow.pl/aktualnosci/250011,1912,komunikat,krakow_bedzie_mial_premetro.html">Kraków government press release</a> - there are many problems with this publication but OpenStreetMap related one is fixed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Actual email that I am sending</h3>
  <p>title:</p>
  <p>systematic copyright violation by XYZ</b></p>
  <p>email text:</p>
  <p>Hello!</p>
  <p>As one of the authors, I am very happy to see OpenStreetMap data being used</p>
  <p>But LINK and other pages on that site has a map with a misleading attribution.</p>
  <p>It must be attributed to the actual data source, OpenStreetMap project. See https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</p>
  <p>I recommend "© OpenStreetMap (ODBL)" linking to https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright</p>
  <p>In cases where Foobar data is also shown, I recommend "© Foobar © OpenStreetMap (ODBL) for background map" or similar.</p>
  <p>-- Mateusz Konieczny</p>

  <h4>Yes, it often works!</h4>
  <p>Fixes mentioned earlier were triggered by sending an email.</p>
  <p>But if problem is not fixed after reporting it, normal mapper has no good further steps.</p>
  <p>OSMF can and should act in such cases.</p>

  <h3>Facebook</h3>
  
   <p>Facebook is in business of selling attention of their users and their screen space.</p>

   <p>Even full screen maps are hiding attribution and require a click on weird button to see it.</p>

   <p>Ad shown under every single map on their platform would be worth massive amount of money and we are entitled to it.</p>

   <p>What would be the value of an ad under every single map on FB?</p>

   <h2>Conflict of interest</h2>
   <p>We should be aware that it is in our interest that a clear attribution will be visible.</p>
   <p>It is not in interest of various entities to attribute OpenStreetMap.</p>

   <h2>Lets make OpenStreetMap known more widely</h2>
   <p>Ask users to clearly state source, it is one of our conditions.</p>
   <p>It is useful to log reports on “<a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Lacking_proper_attribution">Lacking proper attribution</a>” page at OSM Wiki.</p>
   <p>OpenStreetMap Foundation should act in cases where it is not sufficient</p>

   <p>Right now we are:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Losing potential contributors, in way that preserves unusual demographics of OSM</li>
    <li>Losing chances to grow awareness of OSM</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Thanks!</h2>
   <p>To everyone who is using OpenStreetMap data and has honestly tried to credit it. Thanks also to people who fixed missing attribution.</p>
   <h2>Language</h2>
   <p>English is not my native language, let me know about what is the most important to improve.</p>
